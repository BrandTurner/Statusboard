# Statusboard

### Install

1. Download/clone and run `composer install`
2. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the `HELPSCOUT_API_KEY`
3. Setup and run as a website (e.g. using MAMP) using the address `db-statusboard.dev` (this address is required for oauth callbacks to work)

### Usage

I recommend using an app like [Fluid](http://fluidapp.com/) to make it feel more like an "app" and
add it to your dock. Point fluid to your web address and add an icon if you want.

Once the app is up and running you will need to authenticate with Slack and GitHub. Follow onscreen instructions.
